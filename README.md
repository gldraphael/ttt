# ttt

A really simple tictactoe game for the console.

I've also written one using MonoGame if you're looking for GUI: https://github.com/gldraphael/mg-ttt

## Running the program

1. Clone the repository
1. `cd` into the cloned directory and run `make`
1. An `a.out` executable should be generated. Run it using `./a.out`.

Alternatively you may paste this in your terminal:

```bash
https://github.com/gldraphael/ttt.git
cd ttt
./a.out
```
